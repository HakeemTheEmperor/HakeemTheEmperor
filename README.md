# Hi, I'm **Toluwalase Akinyemi** [HTE] 👋

I'm a software developer who loves diving into new projects and learning something new every day. I'm always up for a challenge and excited to see what I can build. If it's believed to be possible, I'll try it out, if not, I'll still try it out 😂😂😂

## 🚀 About Me

* 💻 **Full-Stack Dev:** Happily getting lost in the weeds of front-end, back-end, and everything in between. Fluent in various tech stacks.
* 🧠 **Self-Taught & Stubborn:** My main instructors? Stack Overflow, Documentation, Various tutorials (Mosh Hamedani, Jonas Schmedtmann, Angela Yu...) and a refusal to quit. Driven by figuring out *why* things break (and then fixing them).
* 🎓 **CS50x Survivor:** Went toe-to-toe with Harvard's CS50x and emerged victorious (mostly intact, just don't mention pointers or memory management to me and we'll be cool) 😭😭😭.

## Tech Stack
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,ts,cs,html,css,py,sass,react,tailwind,docker,dotnet,postgres,mysql,mongodb,nodejs,nestjs,bootstrap)](https://skillicons.dev)

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
* 🤖 **AI Engineering:** Dipping my toes into AI. Current mission: Figure out how neural networks *actually* work. Endgame: Building F.R.I.D.A.Y. (Should be simple enough, right?).
* 🌐 **Web3:** Venturing down the blockchain rabbit hole. Still figuring out if 'decentralized' just means 'more confusing'. Accepting explainer donations (or ETH).
