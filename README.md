## 🚀 About Me

* 💻 **Full-Stack Dev:** Happily getting lost in the weeds of front-end, back-end, and everything in between. Fluent in various tech stacks.
* 🧠 **Self-Taught & Stubborn:** My main instructors? Stack Overflow, Documentation, Various YouTube tutorials (Mosh Hamedani, Jonas Schmedtmann, Angela Yu...) and a refusal to quit. Driven by figuring out *why* things break (and then fixing them).
* 🎓 **CS50x Survivor:** Went toe-to-toe with Harvard's CS50x and emerged victorious (mostly intact). Still have nightmares about pointers and memory management 😭😭😭.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
* 🤖 **AI Engineering Explorer:** Dipping my toes into AI. Current mission: Figure out how neural networks *actually* work. Endgame: Building F.R.I.D.A.Y. (Should be simple enough, right?).
* 🌐 **Web3 Curious:** Venturing down the blockchain rabbit hole. Still figuring out if 'decentralized' just means 'more confusing'. Accepting explainer donations (or ETH).
